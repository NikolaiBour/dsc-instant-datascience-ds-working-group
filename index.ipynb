    "When starting any course, you likely look at the syllabus to see what's covered and ask yourself if you can do it. In this lesson, we'll hope to give you a sense of how, with just a little bit of knowledge, you can make some real progress in using programs to answer questions with data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To do so, we will be introducing the following topics: \n",
    "* Data types: working with text and data \n",
    "* Variables: storing data\n",
    "* Lists: working with data in an ordered collection\n",
    "* Dictionaries: representing data as a collection of attributes   \n",
    "* Loops and iteration: repeating a sequence of instructions  \n",
    "* Data visualization: using plots to display data\n",
    "* Functions: defining and running specific procedures in code \n",

    "This lesson will offer a brief glimpse into each of these topics. In the rest of the course, we will provide lessons and labs on each of these topics to break down the material step by step. Let's get started!\n",

    "What makes a hit record?  Does repetitiveness help?  Is our music getting more repetitive over time?  Questions like these were asked by the great computer scientist Donald Knuth in 1977, and then they were asked again and answered, by Colin Morris in [this article](https://pudding.cool/2017/05/song-repetition/).\n",

    "It keeps going, but you get the point.  Now let's say that we wanted to count up how many times each word in the above selection appears.  Without a computer, we could do the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Place each of the words on a separate index card\n",
    "* Designate a spot for each unique word in our index cards\n",
    "* Then, flip through the index cards one by one\n",
